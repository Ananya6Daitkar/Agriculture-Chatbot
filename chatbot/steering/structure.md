## Project Structure

```
.
├── .kiro/
│   └── steering/          # AI assistant steering rules and guidelines
├── .vscode/
│   └── settings.json      # VSCode workspace configuration
```

### Organization Principles
- Configuration files are kept at the root level
- AI assistant steering rules are centralized in `.kiro/steering/`
- VSCode-specific settings are isolated in `.vscode/`

### Conventions
- Use markdown for documentation and steering rules
- Keep steering documents focused and concise
- Update steering rules as project conventions emerge
